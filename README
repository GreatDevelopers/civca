There are three files-header.txt,footer.txt,linecircle.cpp that must be in same directory.
linecircle.cpp is a main file that uses other two files for reading and writing to linecircle.dxf file.
I had given the comments in the main file to understand the program.
This program is very useful because user has to give only the inputs,it will automatically generate line and circle according to their wish.

Steps to execute the linecircle.cpp

1. Compile the linecircle.cpp
	$g++ linecircle.cpp -o linecircle

2.Run linecircle
	$./linecircle

Check the output file linecircle.dxf
